# AGameEngine

## Super Quick Guide

To compile AGameEngine, type:
```bash
./compile.sh

```
> Warning: This will fail if you don't have bash, gcc and OpenGL dev libs installed.

Then just start developing, maybe read the wiki because we don't have an editor yet :(

## But How Do I Contribute?

Let's say you want to contribute (which i hope you do), then just follow these instructions!

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the repository page.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```
3. **Create a Branch**: Make your changes in a new branch using
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```
4. **Make Changes**: Add your awesome features, fix bugs, or improve documentation.
5. **Commit Changes**: After making changes, commit them using `git add .` and 
```bash
git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
```
6. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub using 
```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```
7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Go to your fork on GitHub and click "Pull Request". Fill out the template explaining your changes.
8. **Review Process**: Await feedback from maintainers. They may request changes or approve your contribution.
9. **Push to dev Branch**: Make sure you go from your feature to dev where all the expirimental stuff goes or push it to beta if it's ready to test!
```bash
git push origin feature-branch:dev
```
10. **Keep Your Fork Updated**: Regularly sync your fork with the original repository to stay up-to-date with changes.
